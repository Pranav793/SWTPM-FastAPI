Used OpenVPN to login to the maddog box


using the command 'ls /dev/tpm*' to check for tpm directories

also 'sudo dmesg | grep -i tpm' for tpm stuff


Install tpm tools:
- sudo apt-get install tpm2-tools # Install if not already present
- sudo tpm2_getcap properties-fixed


Might need to run shit with sudo :/

Adds user to the tss group, now has full access to run stuff (reload session to gain effects)
- sudo usermod -aG tss $USER
